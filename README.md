# Brain-Tumour-Detection-and-Segmentation-Device
This repo contains the source code for my brain tumour detection and segmentation application. An ensemble model was used for classification of the magnetic resonance (MR) images, and a ResUNET model was used for segmentation. The models were deployed on a web app using Streamlit.

Data preprocessing and visualizationn were done in Project, followed by model building and training in <a href="https://github.com/Oguama77/Brain-Tumour-Detection-and-Segmentation-Device/blob/main/Ensemble_model.ipynb">Ensemble_model</a>. The segmentation model was trained in Segmentation_model, and Model_combo contains code to test the performance of various model combinations. Model_conversion contains code to convert the tensorflow models to tensorflow lite models for ease of deployment
