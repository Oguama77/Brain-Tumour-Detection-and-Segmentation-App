# Brain Tumour Detection and Segmentation Application
This repo contains the source code for my brain tumour detection and segmentation application. An ensemble model was used for classification of the magnetic resonance (MR) images, and a ResUNET model was used for segmentation. The models were deployed on a web app using Streamlit.

Data preprocessing and visualizationn were done in <a href="https://github.com/Oguama77/Brain-Tumour-Detection-and-Segmentation-Device/blob/main/Project.ipynb">Project</a>, followed by model building and training in <a href="https://github.com/Oguama77/Brain-Tumour-Detection-and-Segmentation-Device/blob/main/Ensemble_model.ipynb">Ensemble_model</a>. The segmentation model was trained in <a href="https://github.com/Oguama77/Brain-Tumour-Detection-and-Segmentation-Device/blob/main/Segmentation_model.ipynb">Segmentation_model</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Oguama77/Brain-Tumour-Detection-and-Segmentation-Device/blob/main/Model_combo.ipynb">Model_combo</a> contains code to test the performance of various model combinations. <a href="https://github.com/Oguama77/Brain-Tumour-Detection-and-Segmentation-Device/blob/main/Model_conversion.ipynb">Model_conversion</a> contains code to convert the tensorflow models to tensorflow lite models for ease of deployment
